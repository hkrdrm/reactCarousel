# reactCarousel
React Component that auto builds your bootstrap carousel

I'm using php to pull a list image locations that contain the word "promo" in the
filename from a wordpress database and spitting it out into json string.
You could just as easy a create static list.  I just needed a way to dynamically
build a carousel based on what someone uploads to the wordpress site.

Just give the html page div with id=slides and your ready to go.
